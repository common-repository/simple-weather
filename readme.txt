Shows current weather for specified location.

== Description ==

Shows current weather for specified location. Makes use of "secret" Google Weather API, which is
unofficial, yet XML-based and lightweight, and is used by developers quite often. 
The plugin uses cURL, so works even on hosts with some security restricions, like url-disabled file_get_contents.  
If you've downloaded it, consider leaving feedback in my [guestbook](http://recon-by-fire.eu/guestbook1.php), it's
rather important for me. Thanks.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `simple-weather.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Place widget on page, using 'Widgets' menu in WordPress
4. Specify widget settings (still in 'widgets' menu) and click 'save' button. Widget is ready to work.
